### Understand the derivatives of each different segment of ectoderm and how they developed in relation to neurulation and folding
#### **Surface Ectoderm: Epidermis**<a name="epidermis"></a>

`The skin!`
- Derived from the **Somatopleure**. `Somato = Body | Pleure = Wall`
  - Component of surface ectoderm with a component of lateral plate mesoderm
- Most exposed component
  - Protective
  - Interactive
    - Hair, sweating etc
- **Epidermal Appendages** <br/> ```Develop from the Ectoderm, but has embed itself in the Mesoderm (Dermis)```
  - Hair follicles and sebaceous glands
  - Finger Nails
  - Mammary glands
    - Proliferate -> Form buds -> Canalisation (duct system forming within)
    - The secreting tissue of the Mammary tissue is derived from Ectoderm
      - The surrounding tissue is derived from the Mesoderm
- **Water proofing**
  - Keratinised cells provide a layer of dead cell protection
    - Water proofing (hydrophobic)

#### **Surface Ectoderm: Rathke's Pouch**<a name="rathkes-pouch"></a>
```
The Oralpharyngeal membrane forms into a Stomodeum (`Stomo = Opening`)
This is actually just an invagination of the Surface Ectoderm.
    
    Only at the back of the mouth do we have a change between Ectodermal lining
and Endodermal lining which would be where the Oralpharyngeal membrane would have
been located.

    This is relevant due to the dual origin of the Pituitary gland from the Neural
Tube and Rathke's Pouch (from Surface Ectoderm)
```
- Anterior Pituitary
  - `Derivative from Rathke's pouch (Surface Ectoderm)`
- Posterior Pituitary
  - `Neural Component derived from the forebrain`

#### **Surface Ectoderm: 'Seek and Destroy' Organs**<a name="seek-destroy-organs"></a>
```
Seek and Destroy organs references the eye and teeth primarily
```
- **Lens of the eye**
  - Due to the lining of the face, the lens of the eye devolops from an invagination and engulfment of the Surface Ectoderm. [See below](#eye-lens-image1)
- **Enamel of the teeth**
  - Due to the lining of the mouth, the enamel of the teeth develops from the SE. [See below](#enamel-image1)

> The Enamel of the tooth is a derivative of the Surface Ectoderm as shown, however the Dentine derives from the Mesenchyme which is either Mesodermic or Neural Crest in origin
#### **Neural Tube: Central Nervous System**<a name="cns"></a>
```
Forms the Central Nervous System
```
- Walls of the tube form the **Brain & Spinal Cord**
- Canal of the tube form the **Ventricles and Central Canal**
  - These are functional spaces within the brain
  - Allow fluid to flow from Brain right down Spinal Cord

#### **Neural Crest: Peripheral Nervous System**<a name="pns"></a>

#### **Neural Crest: Dorsal Root Ganglion**<a name="drg"></a>
```
Sympathetic Nerves
```
#### **Neural Crest: Autonomic Ganglion**<a name="ag"></a>

#### Paraxial Mesoderm
`Form Somites`

Somites have 3 components:
1. Sclerotome
`Sclero - Bone/Skeleton`
   - Develops into Axial Skeleton
     - Vertebrae including ribs (see [image](#sclerotome-image1))
     - Not responsible for [bones in limbs](#lateral-plate-mesoderm)
2. Dermatome
3. Myotome
> Somites are segmented (see [image](#somites-image1))  
> This is why we have numbered vertebrae  
> Similarly, Myotomes are also segmented  

The Dermatome and Myotome fuse existing as **Dermamyotomes**
- Myotome component
  - Forms the muscles of the body wall & limbs

#### Intermediate Mesoderm
```
Forms paired glands:
    - Kidneys
    - Gonads
    - Accessory Urinary/Reproductive Glands
```

----

#### Lateral Plate Mesoderm
```
Involved with Connective Tissue of the viscera (organs) and body wall.
Has a few special function derivatives too
```
- Somatopleure
  - Body wall
  - Limbs develop as as an extension of the Body Wall
    - Connective tissues, dermis, tendons, bones etc
    - However [not the skeletal muscle](#paraxial-mesoderm)
- Splanchnopleure
- Cranial Mesoderm
  - Complex -> Involved with replacing some derivatives of the Neural Crest Cells in the cranium
- Adrenal Cortex
  - Cortex is formed from mesothelium while the Medulla is formed from Neural Crest Cells

### Describe the level of organisation in the body

Atom -> Molecule -> Macromolecule -> Organelle -> Cell -> Tissue -> Organ -> Organ System -> Organism

### Know the constituents of the intracellular and extracellular environment

Extracellular fluid provides cells a maintained environment for functions

> Extracellular fluid can be divided into two primary constituents:  
> ```
> Fluid component of the blood (Plasma)
> Interstitial Fluid (IF) that surrounds all cells not in blood
> Intracellular Fluid makes up for 60% of the fluid in the body

### Discuss the concept of homeostasis and homeostatic control systems

Two Definitions Provided

> **Homeostasis**: Maintenance of static or constant conditions in the internal environment

> :star: **Homeostasis**: Maintain a steady-state dynamic constancy in a system by resisting change.

Homeostatic Control Systems maintain the stability of the internal system through compensating mechanisms
- Control systems operate via negative feedback
- Antagonistic arms work against each other

Control systems require:
1. Some way to measure the regulated variable
2. Some way to alter (effect) the regulated variable
3. Something linking the two

![](scrnshts/2021-02-08-01-03-01.png)  
> To understand homeostatic control mechanisms:
> 1. Variable? (K+, temp, bp etc)
> 2. Change detection? (receptors)
> 3. Where is decision to act made? (integrating circuit)
> 4. Communication? (afferent/efferent pathways)
> 5. Effectors? (how is variable regulated)
> 6. How does the negative feedback loop operate?

---

**Control Concepts**

|Mechanism|Description|
|-:|:-|
|Negative Feedback|Most Common|
| |Oppose the direction of change then switch themselves off|
|Positive Feedback|**non-homeostatic**|
| |Examples: Blood clotting, neuronal excitation, child birth|


:exclamation: Feed**back** mechanisms are inherently response **after** the fact; the system is "catching up"

---

**Feed-forward Control**

> Anticipatory alteration of effectors - independent of feedback

- Parametric feedforward | Adaptive Control
  - System adapts from previous failures
> Eg: Ballistic control, ball throwing
- Predictive homeostasis | Anticipatory control
  - System anticipates and alters effectors before the causative agent has occured
> Eg: Increasing cardiac function in anticipation of exertion

### Know that multicellular life involves specialisation of individual cells and communication between cells

Do you know this? Now you do.

### Describe and understand the forms of communication between cells

![](scrnshts/2021-02-08-01-13-31.png)

There is also Neuroendocrine

---

**Juxtacrine**

Transmembrane/membrane-bound ligand binds receptor of neighbouring target cell.  

> Neurons notch signalling

---

**Gap Junctions**

Specialised intercellular connection joins the 2 cytoplasms. Allows passage of molecules/ions. Diffusion of these molecules/ions down concentration gradients is the method of communication.

> Cardiac muscle cells propogation of action potentials

---

**Autocrine**

Ligand is secreted into ECF to act on transmembrane receptor of secreting cell.

> Interleukin-1 in monocytes

---

**Paracrine**

Ligand is secreted into the ECF and acts on target cell receptors at a distance-not in direct physical contact

> Fgf

---

**Endocrine**

Ligand is secreted into the blood where it travels and acts on target cells down stream

> Hormones - Insulin

:label: Very common
---

**Neural**

Neuron secretes ligand (neurotransmitters) to act on connected cells.

> Muscle, glands

:label: Neural communication is more specific, however is unfit for more "general" messaging

:label: Very common
---

**Neuroendocrine**

Combined neural and endocrine signalling.

---

It is suggested that knowing the name of the receptor (Baroreceptor) and having a general understanding of how this control system works is sufficient:

![](scrnshts/2021-02-06-12-27-45.png)
### Define an atom (including electron arrangement in shells), electron, neutron and proton

- Atom
  - Building block of all matter
  - Composed of Protons, Neutrons and Electrons
  - Properties are decided by the number of each subatomic particle
- Nucleus
  - Protons & Neutrons
- Proton

      - 6 electrons
    - d
      - 10 electrons
    - f
      - 14 electrons
  - Shell Electron arrangements: 
| Shell Number | Electrons | Sub-Shells |
|-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|2|*1s*|
|2|8|*2s, 2p*|
|3|18|*3s, 3p, 3d*|

> ![](scrnshts/03b911a9366b97b322fce950121053ea.jpg)  
> This shows the order with which sub-shells fill their electron due to the nature of electrons filling Sub-Shells of lower energy over filling Shells of lower energy first.  
> This demonstrates why although Shell 3 should have 18 electrons, it usually has 8.
> 
### Describe covalent and noncovalent bonds and give examples
Sharing/Exchanging e- to fill valence shell forms chemical bonds.  
Atoms join to form molecules.

**Covalent Bonds**
> A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves sharing electron pairs between atoms
> 
> Examples of Covalent bonding:
> - Oxygen
>     - Double Covalent Bond between two oxygen atoms
>     - O=O
> - Water (H2O)
>     - Two Hydrogens Covalent Bonded to Oxygen with Single Covalent Bonds
>     - H-O-H



**Non-Covalent Bonds**
> Do not involve the sharing of electrons.  
> Involves weaker electromagnetic interactions between molecules or within a molecule  
> 
> There are Ionic Bonds, Hydrogen Bonds, Van der Waals forces, Hydrophobic interactions, Dipole-Dipole forces  
> 
> Examples: NaCl; binding forces that keep Water a liquid at room temperature (Hydrogen Bonds)

:label: Covalent bonds form molecules while Non-Covalent bonds bring them together. Examples of this are cellular structures such as Ribosomes.

### Have an understanding of the chemistry of carbon and its importance in organics
> Carbon is the building block of all Organic molecules

|Property|Value (if relevant)|

|Single bonds are shorter than double bonds||
|Single bonds can rotate||
|Aliphatic|Carbon chain compounds|

|**Non Covalent Bonds:**|
|Ionic Bonds|4-80|
|Hydrogen Bonds|12-30|
|Van der Waals|0.3-9|
|Hydrophobic Interactions|weak|


**Covalent Bonds**
> Atoms involved in Covalent Bonds however are not the same. Oxygen would have a much stronger pull on the electrons than Hydrogen would. This ability is measured by Electronegativity.  
> Examples of high Electronegative elements are Fluoride, Oxygen and Nitrogen  
> 
> This is an important concept in organics. In a covalent bond, the shared electrons will be closer towards the more Electronegative atom. This will create a minor polarity or 'charge' across the molecule.  
> ![](scrnshts/2021-02-06-17-25-54.png)  
> :label: Singular Covalent bonds inherently allow some flexibility in the molecule, this is lost in Double Covalent Bonds as seen in Ethane vs Ethene


**Non-Covalent Bonds**
> Below you can see the formation of Ionic Bonds:   
> ![](scrnshts/2021-02-06-17-28-19.png)  
> An example of this is NaCl
> 
> Hydrogen Bonds involves the interaction molecules that contain High Electronegative elements such as Oxygen bound to Hydrogen. The Polarity created in this covalent bond is significant. The Positive polar Hydrogen atoms would interact with the Negative polar bound atoms in other molecules.  
>   
> An example of a material that is heavily dependent on this interaction is Water.  
> It explains why, despite the low molecular weight, that water can exist as a liquid at room temperature.

**Ionic Bonds**

> :label: Not all Ionic bonds involve *complete* e- transfer

|Name|Charge|
|:-:|:-:|
|Cation|+|
|Anion|-|

Due to their charge, Cations and Anions bond together to form Ionic Bonds
> :label: This bond forms due to electromagnetic attraction. Can be broken/dispersed by other electromagnetic interactions. This is seen with **hydration**

**Hydrogen Bonds**

> :label: O-H is a strong dipolar bond. This means O has - polarity while H has + polarity

![](scrnshts/2021-02-06-17-35-53.png)  

### Define polarity, chemistry and properties of water and its role in ionisation and hydration

---

```
Electronegativity is arbitrarily measured; it increases as you go from
left to right, and from bottom to the top of the periodic table.
```

---

:pushpin: Covalent bonds between different electronegative elements have an uneven distribution of charge and therefore have polarity/charge

:pushpin: Electronegative elements: Oxygen, Nitrogen, Fluoride

:grey_question: Below is the electronegative values of biologically important elements. Bonds are considered non-polar if the difference between them is not >0.5

|Element|Electronegativity|
|-:|:-:|
|H|2.1|
|C|2.5|
|**N**|**3**|
|**O**|**3.5**|
|**F**|**4**|

Therefore, molecules lacking electronegative atoms are non polar (eg: Ethane)

|Strong Cohesion|
|Strong Surface Tension|
|Hydrogen bonds ~ 2x longer than O-H|
|Floats as solid|
|Hydrogen Bonds form lattice in solid|
|Excellent solvent for polar solutes|

- H2O is polar
  - Able to interact with other polar & charged groups
  - Forms Hydrogen bonds
- Hydrophilic
  - Groups that interact with water
- Hydrophobic
  - Nonpolar groups

**Ionisation**

When a highly electronegative atom captures electrons from other atoms during chemical reactions

---

**Hydration**

When Polar Water molecules surround ions and 'shield' them from one another.

^ pH = more Basic
v pH = more acidic
pH 7 = neutral
```

**Physiological pH** = 7.4

### Understand the role of buffers

> :grey_exclamation: Remember reversible reactions:
> ```
> Lets say there is a reversible reaction such as the Ionisation of a weak acid:
>   HA  +  H2O <-> H3O+  +  A-
> These reactions have an equilibrium point. Adding more of a chemical of either
> side of the reaction will drive the reaction to remove the added chemical and
> reachieve equilibrium.
> ```

Physiological processes require tight control of pH. This is achieved through buffering.

**Buffers** resist changes in pH usually brought about by addition of acid/base. They are weak acids and/or bases.

### Name and distinguish between organics such as alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, thiols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, amines and aromatics

:grey_exclamation::grey_question: Only Enantiomers and Constitutional Isomers discussed in lecture; there wasn't any direct reference made to Diastereomers


> Molecule is Chiral if it cannot be superposed on its mirror image by any combination of rotations and translations

|Isomerism|Definition|
|-:|:-|
|Structural Isomer|Different in specific attachment of atoms and functional groups|
| |`There are subdivisions under this: Chain isomers; Position isomers; Functional group isomers; Skeletal isomers; Tautomer`
|Stereoisomer|Identical Bond structure but different with geometric position of functional groups & atoms|
|Enantiomers|Mirror images which contain chiral centres & are not superimposable|
|`Diastereomers`|`Are not mirror-images; may or may not contain chiral centers`|
|`Conformational Isomers`|`Different rotations around single bonds`|

:question: Enantiomer and Optical Isomer are interchangeable terms. You could argue it might be more correct to call a set of Optical Isomers Enantiomers. You do you.

:label: Enantiomers are labeled by their deflection of light
|Enantiomer|Light Deflection|
|:-:|:-|
|D|Right|
|L|Left|
|-||
|R|Right|
|S|Left|
|-||
|+|Right|
|-|Left|
> The above is separated into their nomenclature groups. Don't use S with D or + etc. Stick with one. Both groups are easy to remember because L = Left and R = Right. You just have to remember the paired nomenclature.

In relation to Enantiomers, a **racemic** mix has equal amounts of both D and L enantiomers = no optical activity

Enantiomers are detrimental in the development of pharmaceuticals. Often only 1 isomer has desired effect (target cell receptors have isomerism too; you can't expect both isomers to fit the same target).

> :grey_question: Thalidomide was a racemic mix. One isomer was responsible for the relief of morning sickness while the other isomer was the cause of its teratogenicity.
