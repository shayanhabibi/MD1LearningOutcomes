# Introduction

> :grey_exclamation: This document is an accumulation of the Learning Outcomes presented **primarily** in the lectures.  
> :grey_question: When learning outcomes are covered through material outside of the lectures, this is explicitly mentioned. I'll probably start marking those sections with Emojis so it's visually distinctive from the rest of the content
