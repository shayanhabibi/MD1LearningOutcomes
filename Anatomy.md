### Understand the derivatives of each different segment of ectoderm and how they developed in relation to neurulation and folding
#### **Surface Ectoderm: Epidermis**<a name="epidermis"></a>

`The skin!`
- Derived from the **Somatopleure**. `Somato = Body | Pleure = Wall`
  - Component of surface ectoderm with a component of lateral plate mesoderm
- Most exposed component
  - Protective
  - Interactive
    - Hair, sweating etc
- **Epidermal Appendages** <br/> ```Develop from the Ectoderm, but has embed itself in the Mesoderm (Dermis)```
  - Hair follicles and sebaceous glands
  - Finger Nails
  - Mammary glands
    - Proliferate -> Form buds -> Canalisation (duct system forming within)
    - The secreting tissue of the Mammary tissue is derived from Ectoderm
      - The surrounding tissue is derived from the Mesoderm
- **Water proofing**
  - Keratinised cells provide a layer of dead cell protection
    - Water proofing (hydrophobic)
    - Barrier for infection

#### **Surface Ectoderm: Rathke's Pouch**<a name="rathkes-pouch"></a>
```
The Oralpharyngeal membrane forms into a Stomodeum (`Stomo = Opening`)
This is actually just an invagination of the Surface Ectoderm.
    
    Only at the back of the mouth do we have a change between Ectodermal lining
and Endodermal lining which would be where the Oralpharyngeal membrane would have
been located.

    This is relevant due to the dual origin of the Pituitary gland from the Neural
Tube and Rathke's Pouch (from Surface Ectoderm)
```
- Anterior Pituitary
  - `Derivative from Rathke's pouch (Surface Ectoderm)`
- Posterior Pituitary
  - `Neural Component derived from the forebrain`

#### **Surface Ectoderm: 'Seek and Destroy' Organs**<a name="seek-destroy-organs"></a>
```
Seek and Destroy organs references the eye and teeth primarily
```
- **Lens of the eye**
  - Due to the lining of the face, the lens of the eye devolops from an invagination and engulfment of the Surface Ectoderm. [See below](#eye-lens-image1)
- **Enamel of the teeth**
  - Due to the lining of the mouth, the enamel of the teeth develops from the SE. [See below](#enamel-image1)

> ![](scrnshts/2021-02-05-13-40-48.png "Shows the invagination and engulfment of surface ectoderm which will form the eye lens")<a name="eye-lens-image1"></a>  
> Seen here is the invagination and engulfment of the Surface Ectoderm which will differentiate into the Optical Lens

> ![](scrnshts/2021-02-05-13-42-50.png "Shows the development of the Enamel from the Surface Ectoderm")<a name="enamel-image1"></a>  
> The Enamel of the tooth is a derivative of the Surface Ectoderm as shown, however the Dentine derives from the Mesenchyme which is either Mesodermic or Neural Crest in origin
#### **Neural Tube: Central Nervous System**<a name="cns"></a>
```
Forms the Central Nervous System
```
- Walls of the tube form the **Brain & Spinal Cord**
- Canal of the tube form the **Ventricles and Central Canal**
  - These are functional spaces within the brain
  - Allow fluid to flow from Brain right down Spinal Cord

#### **Neural Crest: Peripheral Nervous System**<a name="pns"></a>

#### **Neural Crest: Dorsal Root Ganglion**<a name="drg"></a>
```
Sympathetic Nerves
```
#### **Neural Crest: Autonomic Ganglion**<a name="ag"></a>

#### **Neural Crest: Adrenal Medulla**<a name="am"></a>
```
The Medulla of the Adrenal gland is formed from derivatives of Neural Crest
cells while the Cortex of the Adrenal gland is formed from the Mesothelium
```

#### Paraxial Mesoderm
`Form Somites`

Somites have 3 components:
1. Sclerotome
`Sclero - Bone/Skeleton`
   - Develops into Axial Skeleton
     - Vertebrae including ribs (see [image](#sclerotome-image1))
     - Not responsible for [bones in limbs](#lateral-plate-mesoderm)
2. Dermatome
3. Myotome
> Somites are segmented (see [image](#somites-image1))  
> This is why we have numbered vertebrae  
> Similarly, Myotomes are also segmented  

The Dermatome and Myotome fuse existing as **Dermamyotomes**
- Myotome component
  - Forms the muscles of the body wall & limbs


> ![](scrnshts/2021-02-06-11-42-52.png "Sclerotome migrating around neural tube to form axial skeletal vertebrae")<a name="sclerotome-image1"></a>  
> Seen above is migration of Sclerotome to surround the Neural Tube as is expected in formation of our vertebrae

> Seen here is an embryo with clear division of the somites along the dorsal surface

----

#### Intermediate Mesoderm
```
Forms paired glands:
    - Kidneys
    - Gonads
    - Accessory Urinary/Reproductive Glands
```

----

#### Lateral Plate Mesoderm
```
Involved with Connective Tissue of the viscera (organs) and body wall.
Has a few special function derivatives too
```
- Somatopleure
  - Body wall
  - Limbs develop as as an extension of the Body Wall
    - Connective tissues, dermis, tendons, bones etc
    - However [not the skeletal muscle](#paraxial-mesoderm)
- Splanchnopleure
- Cranial Mesoderm
  - Complex -> Involved with replacing some derivatives of the Neural Crest Cells in the cranium
- Adrenal Cortex
  - Cortex is formed from mesothelium while the Medulla is formed from Neural Crest Cells
